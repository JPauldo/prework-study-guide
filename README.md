# Pre-work Study Guide

## Description

A study guide website for pre-work notes to help keep one organized and on track throughout boot camp. By providing information around some of the terminology used during the modules of the pre-work course, it should help a student to refresh on the concepts they may not have firm grasps on. Through development, I was able to gain a high-level understanding of web development tools as well as a basic understanding of how to operate Git and GitHub.

## Usage

This webpage was designed to help someone who wants a quick refresher on the information they learned during the course. It provides the definitions on the terms and concepts detailed in the course around web development, such as HTML. It also provides info on Git commands that every developer should know when working at a command line level. If you are using Chrome and would like to see the the underlying Javascript, you can right-click the page, select "Inspect" which will open up the DevTools and click on the console tab. (Note: you can also use the shortcut Command+Option+I  for macOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows to open DevTools.) Here you will see the topics on display on the site as well as suggestion on which on to review.
